This project uses sessions and can not be run on localhost

you have to edit your hosts file and add your desired subdomains

like this :

127.0.0.1      api.u.bz
127.0.0.1       b.bz



- [ ] add logger system

a huge issue with the system is the error handling.
in some parts we are return the sql error!!! which is a huge security issue.
